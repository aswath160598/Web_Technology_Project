    <div class="p3"><center><h3>How do I design my living room?</h3></center>While designing your living room, it’s a good idea to think about certain key aspects like space available, the colours to be used, the kind of furniture and accessories you fancy. When styling larger rooms, use of space is crucial. Strategic use of carpets, furniture can help to a balanced environment, that is pleasurable to spend time in.

    <div class="p2"><center><h3>What wall colour should I use in my living room?</h3></center>A living room is the space where people spend plenty of time, so it is important to create a balanced atmosphere. Usually, for smaller rooms, white walls or pastel tones are appropriate. Bold colours can optically reduce the impression of space. However, in larger living rooms, you can use vivid colours and patterns, depending on the style that is being implemented.</div><br>
    
    <div class="p3"><center><h3>What type of flooring should I use in my living room?</h3></center>There are plenty of options to use for living room floors, and you can choose from stone, wood and tiles or even cover the floor entirely or partly with a carpet. A rug or carpet will create a soft and comfortable surface for the colder months. In cooler climat    es, it’s a great idea to have a soft furnishing to add some extra comfort. Also wooden furniture can be used timelessly and gives the impression of elegant and classy. High quality wooden floor could be perfect for your living room but requires high maintenance.</div><br>

    <div class="p2"><center><h3>How do I select a living room design?</h3></center>It completely depends on the people what mood they want to create within the living room. People who often move houses, or are open to experiment with interior design, a minimalist style living room may be ideal as it is simpler to rearrange furniture and accessories after moving. Bigger families may prefer a well furnished and spacious living room, while couples and young people may go for modern living room designs.</div><br>
    
    <div class="p3"><center><h3>Are there any specific living room decorating tips?</h3></center>The best advice while decorating a living room is to find a balance between modern and flexible furniture. In smaller living rooms, make maximum use of the space by installing the television in a wall-mounted cabinet. Don’t go overboard on decoration, and try to manage the amount of seating space so that people can move around easily. Many people also like to include a decorative focal point like a mirror or painting to to the room. Flowers located around the room add to a light, organic effect. Balance and harmony are key at all times when designing a living room.</div><br>

    <div class="p2"><h4>Country Style Living Rooms:</h4>A country style living room design often include traditional features like large brick-built hearths, broad timber beams and carpets, although undecorated wooden floors work really well in a country style living room. Large dining tables and accessories like candles can also be great additions.</div><br>
    <div class="p3"><h4>Minimalist living rooms:</h4>Drawing on the techniques of modernist architecture, minimalism is all about making the most out of as little as possible. Stark, sleek lines combine well with open space, strategically placed carpets and seating to simplify the living room as much as possible. The challenge is to create a harmonious minimalist living room without making it seem cold .</div><br>
    <div class="p2"><h4>Classic living rooms:</h4>A classic living room is spacious and has abundant light. Generally, classic designs have generous seating, bright colours and decorations, but will avoid any loss of balance or poise in the arrangement. Flowers are a fine addition to any classical living room, adding warmth and lightness to the arrangement.</div><br>
    <div class="p3"><h4>Rustic style living rooms:</h4>Rustic style living rooms are generally large, spacious and welcoming. Big windows and decorative curtains combined with brick fireplaces, sideboards and wooden floors, along with impressive timber beams to create living spaces where the whole family can spend quality time together.</div><br>
    <div class="p2"><h4>Modern living rooms:</h4>Modern living rooms sit between the stylish minimalist designs and the energy of classic designs. They are never cluttered or chaotic, with skilfully chosen decorations and accessories such as designer seating and lighting. A classically modern living room design will generally avoid bright colours, preferring pure white walls and muted tones.</div>
